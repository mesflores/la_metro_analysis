# LA Metro Analysis

Playing around with LA Metro schedule and arrival data.

Currently, will make a cute plot of intserstation times (based on the median of all scheduled runs. Currently this is a little silly, as there is only 2 minutes of variation in the whole thing at time of writing).

Running is something like:

1) Fetch the latest GTFS:

    analysis_fetch

2) Plot:

    plot_times
